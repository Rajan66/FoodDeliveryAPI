## **Food Ordering System API**
As the name suggests, it's an api for an online food ordering system, built using Spring Boot, Hibernate, Docker and PostgreSQL.

*Yet to write test cases, but cleared out of some test cases.*<br/>
For unit testing of Service layer, I've used JUnit and Mockito.
For intergration testing, I've used Spring MockMVC.

Features this API includes:
  - Restaurants can have multiple menus and each menu can have multiple foods.
  - Spring Security and JWT Auth Filter is used for robust security.
  - Mappers and DTOs are implemented for encapsulating data and hiding sensitive data like passwords.


The API is deployed at: [FoodDeliveryAPI](https://fooddeliveryapi-c4g4.onrender.com)
